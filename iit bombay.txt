Different programs have specific admission criteria and entrance examination requirements ensuring that selected candidates possess the necessary aptitude, academic preparation, and potential for rigorous technical education and research. The institute admits students to various undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs through nationally and internationally recognized entrance examinations including JEE Advanced for undergraduate engineering programs, UCEED for undergraduate design programs, GATE for postgraduate engineering programs, CEED for postgraduate design programs, IIT JAM for postgraduate science programs, CAT for MBA programs, and department-specific tests for Ph.D programs. The admission process is transparent, following strict timelines and procedures established by the institute and national regulatory bodies. International students are admitted through designated pathways contributing to campus diversity. IIT Bombay follows reservation policies as mandated by the Government of India ensuring representation for SC, ST, OBC, EWS, and PwD categories. Admissions for undergraduate programs are conducted centrally through Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) for engineering programs and through separate admission processes for design and science programs.

Conducted annually by one of the IITs on rotational basis under the Joint Admission Board (JAB), JEE Advanced assesses candidates' deep understanding of Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics based on Class 11 and 12 CBSE and equivalent board syllabi. The examination tests analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and conceptual clarity rather than mere factual knowledge.",
          "eligibility_criteria": "To be eligible for JEE Advanced, candidates must first qualify JEE Main and rank among the top 2,50,000 candidates across all categories (General, OBC-NCL, SC, ST, EWS, PwD). Educational qualifications require candidates to have passed Class 12 or equivalent examination in 2024 or 2025 with Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as compulsory subjects. Candidates must secure minimum 75% aggregate marks in Class 12 (or be in top 20 percentile in their respective board) for General and OBC-NCL categories, while SC/ST/PwD candidates need 65% aggregate marks. Age limit restrictions apply with candidates born on or after October 1, 2000 for General/OBC-NCL and October 1, 1995 for SC/ST/PwD being eligible. Maximum two attempts are allowed in consecutive years. Candidates who have previously been admitted to IIT (except under specific conditions) are not eligible to reappear.",
          "exam_pattern": "JEE Advanced consists of two compulsory papers (Paper 1 and Paper 2), each of three hours duration. Paper 1 is typically scheduled from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and Paper 2 from 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM on the same day. Both papers cover Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. The exam is conducted in Computer-Based Test (CBT) mode at designated centers across India and some international locations. Each paper contains various question types including multiple-choice questions with one or more correct answers, numerical answer type questions requiring calculation of numeric values, and other innovative formats testing conceptual understanding and analytical skills. Negative marking applies for incorrect answers in most question types. Candidates must attempt both papers and meet minimum marks in each subject and overall to qualify.",

JoSAA conducts multiple rounds of online counselling where candidates fill their preferences for institute-program combinations ranking them in order of preference. Seat allocation is based on JEE Advanced All India Rank (AIR), category rank, and preferences filled by candidates. Higher ranked candidates get priority in seat allocation. Candidates allocated seats must accept the offer online, pay fees, and report to the allocated institute within specified timelines to confirm admission. Those not satisfied with allocated seat can participate in subsequent counselling rounds by either accepting current seat provisionally or floating to try for better options. Mock seat allocation is conducted before actual rounds to help candidates understand the process."
