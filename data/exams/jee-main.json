    "About / Overview": "JEE Main 2026 (Joint Entrance Examination – Main) is India's largest national-level engineering entrance test conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA). It is the entry gateway for admission to 31 National Institutes of Technology (NITs), 25+ Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), 35+ Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs), and several reputed state and private universities. The exam also acts as a qualifying test for JEE Advanced 2026, which leads to admission in the IITs. The examination is held twice a year – Session 1 (January 2026) and Session 2 (April 2026). Each year, nearly 13–15 lakh candidates register to compete for around 40,000 seats in top technical colleges across India. Only the top 2,50,000 rank holders (across all categories) based on percentile cutoffs are shortlisted for JEE Advanced. Admissions through JoSAA (Joint Seat Allocation Authority) counselling for NITs, IIITs, and GFTIs are purely merit-based, derived from JEE Main ranks. Scores are also accepted by select state-level universities and private institutions. NTA uses normalization formula to account for variations in difficulty across shifts, with final ranking considering the best of two session scores. The exam is conducted using an advanced digital platform ensuring secure delivery, AI-backed proctoring, and objective evaluation.",
