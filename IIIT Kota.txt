IIIT Kota (Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kota) is an Institute of National Importance under the IIIT (PPP) Act, mentored by MNIT Jaipur, known for its CSE and ECE B.Tech programs, growing placements, and hostel-based campus life in Kota, Rajasthan.  It is still relatively young but now has a clear identity, its own permanent campus development, and a consistent placement trajectory that makes it a serious option for JEE Main aspirants.[1][2][3][4]

***

## Overview

- IIIT Kota was established in 2013 under the Public–Private Partnership model with the Government of India, Government of Rajasthan and industry partners; it has since been declared an Institute of National Importance.[2][3][5]
- Academically, the institute focuses on Information Technology and allied areas with B.Tech programs in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) and Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE), along with higher degree and research options mentioned in recent institute and guide profiles.[4][1][2]

### Identity and mentoring

- In its initial years, IIIT Kota operated from the campus of its mentor, MNIT Jaipur; more recent information and contact listings show a distinct permanent campus address in Kota, Rajasthan (pincode 325003), indicating progress towards full physical independence.[6][3][5]
- The institute positions itself as a technology‑driven campus with focus on coding culture, projects and industry interaction through its Training and Placement Cell and collaborations.[7][4]

## Courses and Fee

IIIT Kota’s core offerings at UG level are tech-centric, with CSE being the primary high‑demand course.[8][1][2]

### Programs offered

| Level | Programme examples | Notes |
|-------|--------------------|-------|
| UG    | B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) | Flagship, highest demand in cut-offs. [1][2][5] |
| UG    | B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) | Second main branch. [1][2][5] |
| PG / PhD | M.Tech / PhD in select areas (as per recent guides) | Mentioned in some 2025 guides as ongoing/developing offerings; details vary by year. [9][4] |

### Indicative fee structure (B.Tech)

Different portals and the institute page provide consistent ballpark figures for the B.Tech fee.[9][10]

| Component                         | Approx. amount (latest data) | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Total tuition for 4 years (B.Tech)| Around ₹7.0–7.2 lakh         | Tuition only estimate. [9][10] |
| Hostel fees (per year)           | In tens of thousands (exact varies by room and year) | Separate from tuition. [11][12] |
| Mess charges                      | Charged separately based on usage; typically per semester. [11][12] |
| One-time/other charges            | Admission, caution, etc., as per institute fee table. [10] |

- One detailed guide notes B.Tech tuition as roughly ₹7.2 lakh total for four years for the 2025–26 cycle, with M.Tech and PhD fees lower due to shorter duration and/or stipends.[9]
- Hostel and mess fees are additional; hostel fee structures and mess bills are updated periodically and should always be cross‑checked with the official IIIT Kota fee page for the current academic year.[11][10][12]

## Admissions

Admissions to IIIT Kota follow the standard centrally run counselling model based on JEE Main.[13][1][8]

### Mode and eligibility

- Entry to B.Tech CSE and ECE is through JEE Main followed by JoSAA/CSAB counselling; candidates must choose “Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Kota” in their choice filling.[1][8][13]
- Eligibility is as per JEE Main rules: 10+2 or equivalent with Physics and Mathematics and specified subjects, with percentage criteria and relaxations as per category norms of the Government of India.[5][8]

### Admission process

1. Appear in JEE Main of the relevant year and obtain an All India Rank.[8]
2. Register for JoSAA counselling, fill in IIIT Kota and preferred branches (CSE/ECE).[13][8]
3. Seat allotment happens based on rank, category, seat matrix and preferences; candidates confirm by document verification and paying the initial fee.[5][1]

## Placements

IIIT Kota has reached a stage where its placement statistics are robust for CSE and reasonably good for ECE, with clear year‑on‑year progression.[14][15][16][1]

### Recent placement snapshot (B.Tech)

From 2025 placement reports on public portals:[15][16][14]

| Metric (2025)            | Value / trend |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| Highest package          | About ₹54 LPA. [14][16] |
| Average package (overall)| Around ₹11.1 LPA. [14][15] |
| Placement rate           | Around 71–72% overall. [14][15] |

- CSE usually sees higher average and median packages compared to ECE due to the nature of recruiter demand.[16][1]
- The Training and Placement Cell (TnP) emphasises both technical preparation (coding, projects) and soft skills, and notes active participation from product companies, IT services and start‑ups among recruiters.[7][4]

## Rankings

Rankings for IIIT Kota reflect its status as an Institute of National Importance but also its relatively young age compared to long‑established NITs/IITs.[2][1][8]

- Official institute pages and JoSAA documents emphasise the legal status under an Act of Parliament more than commercial ranking lists, which gives it strong recognition for government and public sector opportunities.[3][5]
- In popular comparison articles and guides, IIIT Kota is usually placed in the mid‑range cluster among IIITs—below premier IIITs like Hyderabad or Allahabad, but comparable or superior to many newer IIITs and several private colleges, especially for CSE.[4][2][9]
