        "description": "SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST), commonly known as SRM University, stands as one of India's leading private deemed universities and a premier destination for technical education. Founded in 1985 by Dr. T.R. Paarivendhar as SRM Engineering College in Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, the institution has grown into a multi-campus university serving over 50,000 students across seven campuses in India and abroad. The institute gained deemed-to-be-university status in 2002, was renamed SRM University in 2006, and reverted to SRM Institute of Science and Technology in 2017 following UGC guidelines. SRM's motto 'Learn. Leap. Lead.' encapsulates its vision of transforming students into leaders through quality education, research, and innovation. In NIRF 2025 rankings, SRM secured 14th position among Engineering colleges (score 65.83) and 21st in Overall category, making it one of the top private engineering institutions in India. The flagship Kattankulathur campus near Chennai spans 250 acres and houses faculties of Engineering & Technology, Science & Humanities, Medicine & Health Sciences, Management, and Law. SRM operates additional campuses in Ramapuram (Chennai), Vadapalani (Chennai), Tiruchirappalli (Trichy), NCR Delhi-Sonepat, NCR Modinagar, and an international campus in Amaravati (Andhra Pradesh). The university has been accredited with A++ grade by NAAC and holds NBA accreditation for its programs. Internationally, SRM ranks 1001-1200 in QS World University Rankings and 351-400 in QS Asia Rankings 2024. The institute attracts 900+ companies for placements with highest package of ₹65 LPA and average of ₹7.19 LPA, offering programs across engineering (43 B.Tech specializations), sciences, medicine, management, law, and humanities.",

Paarivendhar established SRM Engineering College in Kattankulathur, a town located approximately 45 km southwest of Chennai on the Chennai-Trichy highway (NH-45). The college started with modest infrastructure offering undergraduate engineering programs affiliated to the University of Madras. The founder's vision was to create an institution that would revolutionize technical education in India by providing world-class facilities, quality faculty, and industry-relevant curriculum. The early years (1985-1992) focused on establishing the core engineering programs in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Electronics Engineering, building laboratory and workshop facilities, recruiting qualified faculty with strong academic credentials, developing campus infrastructure, and creating a culture of academic excellence and discipline.",

This expansion transformed SRM from a single engineering college into a comprehensive educational group offering programs across multiple disciplines. The period also saw introduction of new engineering specializations responding to emerging technologies and industry needs including Computer Science and Engineering (rapidly growing with IT industry boom), Electronics and Communication, Information Technology, and specialized branches. Infrastructure development accelerated with construction of new academic buildings, laboratories equipped with modern instruments, hostel facilities to accommodate growing student population, library expansion with books and journals, and sports and recreational facilities.",

This recognition acknowledged the institution's academic excellence, research capabilities, quality infrastructure, qualified faculty, and contribution to higher education. The deemed university status provided crucial autonomy to design curricula aligned with industry needs without waiting for university approvals, conduct examinations on its own schedule and pattern, award degrees independently (B.Tech, M.Tech, MBA, M.Sc, Ph.D., medical degrees), set admission criteria and conduct entrance examinations (SRMJEEE), establish new programs and departments based on emerging fields, recruit faculty with flexibility, innovate in pedagogy and educational delivery, and collaborate with international universities for joint programs. This autonomy enabled SRM to respond quickly to technological changes, introduce innovative courses, and maintain quality standards comparable to top global universities.",

This period saw significant expansion including establishment of Ramapuram campus in Chennai for engineering and management programs, Vadapalani campus in Chennai focusing on specific programs, and expansion to new geographies. Major developments included introducing cutting-edge B.Tech specializations in emerging fields like Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Genetic Engineering, Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics, Cyber Security, Robotics, and AI & Machine Learning; launching medical programs (MBBS, BDS, nursing) through SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre; establishing School of Management offering MBA and BBA programs; starting law programs (B.A.LLB, B.Com.LLB); expanding research infrastructure with establishment of research centers; and growing international collaborations and student exchange programs.",
