        "title": "About Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education",
        "description": "Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education (KARE), formerly known as Arulmigu Kalasalingam College of Engineering, stands as one of South India's prominent deemed universities with a legacy spanning over four decades. Established in 1984 by the Kalasalingam and Anandam Ammal Charities under the visionary leadership of 'Kalvi Vallal' (Education Magnate) Thiru T. Kalasalingam - a renowned freedom fighter, philanthropist, and education pioneer - the institution began its journey as a humble engineering college dedicated to providing quality technical education in rural Tamil Nadu. Located at the pristine foothills of the scenic Western Ghats in Krishnankoil, Virudhunagar district of southern Tamil Nadu (coordinates: 9°34'29'N, 77°40'36'E), near the Thirumangalam-Kollam highway (NH 744), KARE has transformed from a single engineering college into a comprehensive multi-disciplinary deemed university. In 2006, a landmark achievement was realized when the college was granted deemed-to-be-university status by the University Grants Commission (UGC), recognizing two decades of academic excellence and enabling independent degree-granting authority. Following the UGC directive of November 2017 requiring institutions with deemed university status to drop 'University' from their names, the institution was renamed Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education, emphasizing its commitment to advanced research alongside education. KARE has been accredited with A++ grade by NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) with CGPA of 3.11, the highest accreditation level, validating excellence across teaching, research, infrastructure, and governance. In NIRF 2025 rankings, KARE secured 33rd position in Engineering, 30th in University category (per some sources 30th, others indicate 35th range), 50th Overall, 48th in Management, and 30th in Science, establishing itself among India's top deemed universities. Six undergraduate programs have been accredited by NBA (National Board of Accreditation) under Tier-1, ensuring compliance with quality standards. The institution serves thousands of students across nine specialized schools offering 30+ undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in Engineering, Science, Technology, Humanities, Management, Law, and other disciplines. The 2024 placements recorded highest package of ₹50 LPA with average of ₹4.50 LPA, and over 1,650 placement offers from 150+ recruiters including tech giants like Accenture, Amazon, Cognizant, Dell, HCL, LG, and ICICI Bank. What distinguishes KARE is its pioneering role as the first institution in India to introduce a special B.Tech program for differently-abled students (speech and hearing impaired), demonstrating commitment to inclusive education; establishment of the National Centre for Advanced Research in Discrete Mathematics with DST (Department of Science and Technology) funding; location in rural Tamil Nadu yet providing urban-quality infrastructure and opportunities; focus on holistic student development through intra-mural and extra-mural activities; and affordable fee structure making quality education accessible to students from all economic backgrounds.",

        "philanthropic_roots": "In 1984, during a period when higher technical education was largely concentrated in urban centers and inaccessible to rural populations, 'Kalvi Vallal' Thiru T. Kalasalingam took a bold step to democratize engineering education by establishing Arulmigu Kalasalingam College of Engineering under the trust Kalasalingam and Anandam Ammal Charities. Thiru T. Kalasalingam was not merely an education entrepreneur but a freedom fighter who had actively participated in India's independence struggle and a philanthropist deeply committed to social upliftment through education. The honorific title 'Kalvi Vallal' (literally meaning 'Education Magnate' or 'Generous Donor of Education') reflected his dedication to making quality education accessible regardless of students' socio-economic backgrounds. The choice of Krishnankoil in Virudhunagar district, a rural location in southern Tamil Nadu at the foothills of the Western Ghats, was intentional and revolutionary. While most engineering colleges were concentrated in cities like Chennai, Coimbatore, and Madurai, establishing an engineering college in a rural area represented a vision to bring education to students in rural and semi-urban areas who otherwise would have to migrate to distant cities, making education more affordable and accessible to economically weaker sections while maintaining quality standards comparable to urban institutions. The founding vision emphasized providing affordable quality technical education accessible to all strata of society, creating socially responsible engineers committed to nation-building, integrating education with ethical and human values rooted in Indian culture, and contributing to regional development through educated youth serving local industries and communities. The trust structure ensured that the institution would operate on not-for-profit principles with revenues reinvested in educational infrastructure and student welfare rather than private profit.",

This recognition acknowledged the college's academic quality, qualified faculty, research initiatives, infrastructure quality, and sustained contribution to engineering education over more than two decades. The deemed university status fundamentally transformed the institution's capabilities and identity by providing autonomy to design curricula aligned with industry needs and global standards without waiting for university approvals, conducting examinations on its own schedule with flexible evaluation methods including continuous assessment, awarding degrees independently under its own name (B.Tech, M.Tech, MBA, M.Sc, Ph.D., etc.), setting admission criteria and conducting entrance examinations (KARE developed KUEE, KEEE for various programs), establishing new programs and departments across multiple disciplines beyond just engineering, innovating in pedagogy and teaching methods, recruiting faculty based on institutional requirements, entering into collaborations with international universities and industries directly, and pursuing research, consultancy, and extension activities autonomously. The institution was officially renamed Kalasalingam University (though it would later revert to Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education following 2017 UGC guidelines). The deemed university status enabled KARE to expand from a single-discipline engineering college into a multi-disciplinary university offering programs across Engineering, Sciences, Management, Humanities, Law, and other fields, positioning it among India's premier private deemed universities.",
