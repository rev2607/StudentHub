        "description": "Siksha 'O' Anusandhan (SOA), meaning 'Education and Research' in Odia language, stands as one of India's premier multi-disciplinary deemed universities and a pioneering educational institution in eastern India. Founded by Dr. Manojranjan Nayak in 1984 initially as a small educational society, the institution began its journey as the Institute of Technical Education and Research (ITER) in 1996 in Bhubaneswar, Odisha's capital city. After over a decade of consistent academic excellence, the University Grants Commission (UGC) recognized SOA's outstanding contribution to technical and professional education by granting it deemed-to-be-university status on July 17, 2007 under Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956. In 2022, SOA achieved another major milestone when the UGC awarded it prestigious Category-I Graded Autonomy Status, placing it among the elite group of India's most autonomous and high-quality institutions with maximum operational freedom. Spread across 450 acres (per some sources) or 127 acres of fully Wi-Fi enabled campuses (per other sources - likely referring to built-up areas versus total land) with total built-up area of nearly 4.5 lakh square meters in Bhubaneswar, SOA has evolved into a comprehensive university offering programs across Engineering, Medicine, Dental Sciences, Pharmacy, Law, Management, Nursing, Agriculture, Biotechnology, Science, Humanities, and numerous other disciplines. In NIRF 2025 rankings, SOA achieved remarkable success securing 15th position among Universities nationally (improved from 14th in 2024), 25th in Overall category, 22nd in Engineering (improved from 26th in 2024), 15th in Medical (improved from 21st in 2024), 9th in Dental (maintaining its 2024 rank), and 10th in Law. The Institute of Technical Education and Research (ITER), SOA's engineering faculty, was ranked 2nd in India by Times Engineering Institutes Ranking 2025, 2nd among private engineering institutes nationally, and 1st in eastern India. SOA was reaccredited with A++ grade by NAAC in 2022, the highest accreditation level, validating excellence across all parameters. The 2024 placements recorded highest domestic package of ₹43-46 LPA with average of ₹5.75 LPA, and 1,836 students placed through campus recruitment by 256 companies including giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe, Accenture, Cognizant, and Deloitte. Serving thousands of students across multiple faculties with over 1,000 faculty members, SOA has established itself as eastern India's leading private deemed university. What distinguishes SOA is its rapid ascent from a 1996 engineering college to a top-15 university within two decades, multidisciplinary excellence spanning engineering to medicine to law, commitment to research and innovation with multiple research centers, social responsibility through affordable education and community service, beautiful campus infrastructure at Bhubaneswar, and consistent improvement in national rankings demonstrating sustained quality enhancement.",

The name 'Siksha 'O' Anusandhan' literally translates to 'Education and Research' in Odia (Oriya) language, reflecting the founder's vision that education must be research-driven and inquiry-based rather than mere rote learning. Dr. Nayak's vision was rooted in several core principles: democratizing quality education making it accessible beyond just privileged urban elite to rural and economically disadvantaged students, integrating education with social responsibility and community service, promoting research and innovation alongside traditional teaching, fostering holistic personality development combining technical competence with human values, and contributing to Odisha's socio-economic development through educated youth. The initial years (1984-1996) focused on establishing the foundational infrastructure and organizational framework, building credibility through quality education delivery, and developing connections with industry and government for support and collaborations. This preparatory phase set the stage for SOA's expansion into technical education through establishment of engineering programs.",

ITER received approval from the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to offer B.Tech programs, ensuring compliance with national standards for technical education. Initially, ITER was affiliated with Utkal University, Odisha's premier state university, following the traditional affiliated college model where the university conducted examinations and awarded degrees while ITER provided instruction. The establishment of ITER represented SOA's commitment to addressing India's need for quality technical education and skilled engineers, particularly in the eastern region where technical education infrastructure was relatively underdeveloped compared to South and Western India. Early focus areas included establishing core engineering departments in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics & Communication, and Computer Science Engineering, building laboratory and workshop facilities for hands-on training, recruiting qualified faculty with strong academic credentials and industry experience, developing basic infrastructure including classrooms, hostels, and library, and creating industry connections for student internships and placements. The choice of Bhubaneswar, Odisha's capital and a growing IT and education hub, proved strategic providing access to students from across eastern India while maintaining relatively affordable costs compared to metros like Bangalore or Mumbai.",

This period was characterized by steady enrollment growth from initial modest batches to hundreds of students annually, expansion of engineering programs with addition of specialized branches like Information Technology, Electronics & Instrumentation, Biotechnology, and others responding to industry needs, infrastructure development with construction of additional academic blocks, expansion of laboratory facilities, increased hostel capacity, and library enrichment, faculty recruitment and development hiring qualified teachers and encouraging them to pursue doctoral degrees and research, establishment of placement cell building relationships with companies for campus recruitment achieving good placement rates, and academic excellence with students performing well in BPUT examinations, winning technical competitions, and securing admissions to premier institutions for higher studies. Despite constraints of affiliated college status (fixed curricula, limited autonomy, university-controlled examinations), ITER maintained high quality standards and built a strong reputation within Odisha and neighboring states as one of the best private engineering colleges. This consistent performance over 11 years laid the foundation for deemed university recognition. Simultaneously, SOA expanded into other professional education areas establishing faculties in Pharmacy, Nursing, Biotechnology, Management, and Humanities, creating a multi-disciplinary institution rather than just an engineering college.",

This recognition acknowledged SOA's 11-year track record of academic excellence through ITER, quality of faculty and infrastructure, contribution to technical and professional education in eastern India, commitment to research and innovation, and holistic educational approach. The deemed university status fundamentally transformed SOA's capabilities providing autonomy to design curricula aligned with industry needs and global standards without waiting for university approvals, conduct examinations on its own schedule with flexible evaluation methods, award degrees independently under its own name (B.Tech, M.Tech, MBBS, BDS, MBA, M.Pharm, Ph.D., etc.), set admission criteria and conduct entrance examinations (SAAT - SOA Admission Test), establish new programs and faculties across multiple disciplines, innovate in pedagogy and teaching methods, recruit faculty based on institutional requirements, enter into international collaborations directly with foreign universities, and pursue research, consultancy, and extension activities autonomously. ITER became a constituent institute of SOA Deemed to be University, renamed Institute of Technical Education and Research (ITER), continuing as the faculty of engineering and technology. The deemed status enabled SOA to rapidly expand into new disciplines including medical education (MBBS), dental education (BDS), pharmacy, law, agriculture, nursing, management, and sciences, transforming from primarily an engineering-focused institution into a comprehensive multi-disciplinary university rivaling established state universities in breadth of offerings.",
