The institute emerged as one of eight new Indian Institutes of Technology founded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, representing a pivotal moment in India's commitment to expanding premier technical education infrastructure across the nation. This legislative framework officially declared these new IITs as institutes of national importance, positioning them alongside India's most prestigious educational institutions with autonomy in governance, curriculum design, and degree-granting authority. IIT Patna is one of the most promising and upcoming IITs with a team of young and experienced faculties full of high energy and a desire to excel in new technology and learnings. For 17 years since its inception in 2008, IIT Patna has been a hub of excellence in education, research, and innovation, nurturing brilliant minds, driving groundbreaking discoveries, and contributing to technological and societal progress. With world-class faculty and cutting-edge infrastructure, IIT Patna continues to shape future leaders and innovators. The institute initially operated from a temporary 10 acres (4.0 hectares) complex in Pataliputra Colony, Patna, in buildings which had been renovated and were previously used by the Naveen Government Polytechnic. This transit campus served as the institute's home during its formative years while the permanent campus was being constructed. The transit campus operations began in 2009, marking the practical commencement of academic activities and administrative functions.",

This expansive campus provides ample space for academic buildings, research facilities, residential hostels, sports complexes, administrative offices, green spaces, and future expansion. The campus was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 25 July 2015, marking a significant milestone in the institute's development and Bihar's educational landscape. This inauguration symbolized not just the physical completion of infrastructure but the maturation of an institution that had steadily built its reputation over seven years. The campus site carries unique historical significance, having served as a detention camp during World War II. This transformation from a site of confinement during colonial times to a vibrant center of enlightenment, knowledge creation, and innovation symbolizes human progress and the transformative power of education to reshape landscapes, purposes, and destinies. The institute has consciously preserved this historical context while building modern infrastructure that reflects contemporary educational requirements and sustainability principles. IIT Patna started its new session from July 2015 at its permanent campus at Bihta, transitioning from the transit campus in Pataliputra Colony. The campus development continued in phases, with Phase 2 being completed in 2024, demonstrating the institute's ongoing commitment to infrastructure enhancement and student welfare.",
