        "content": "Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad stands as one of India's oldest and most prestigious technical institutions, with a remarkable legacy spanning nearly a century. The institute was formally inaugurated on 9th December 1926 by Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India, addressing the critical need for trained manpower in the mining and mineral industries during the British Indian era. Established on the lines of the Royal School of Mines in London, the institution was strategically located in Dhanbad, the heart of India's coal-rich region in present-day Jharkhand. The institute's transformation journey reflects India's educational evolution and commitment to technical excellence. For nine decades, it operated as the Indian School of Mines (ISM), earning national and international recognition for its contributions to mining, mineral sciences, and related engineering disciplines. The pivotal moment came on 25th May 2016, when the Union Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the amendment to the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961, paving the way for ISM Dhanbad's conversion into an Indian Institute of Technology. This historic amendment was approved by the Indian Parliament, and following Presidential assent, was officially notified in the Gazette of India on 10th August 2016. This transformation elevated the institution to the prestigious IIT status, making it the third oldest institute after IIT Roorkee and IIT (BHU) Varanasi to achieve this distinction.",
