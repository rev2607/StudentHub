IIT Bhilai is one of the 6 new IITs established in 2016 by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, representing part of the government's ongoing commitment to expanding premier technical education infrastructure across India. Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai was inaugurated on 7 August 2016 by Shri Prakash Javadekar, the then Minister of Human Resources Development, Government of India, and Shri Raman Singh, Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, marking a historic moment for the state of Chhattisgarh. IIT Bhilai was established under The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2016, which officially designated it as an Institute of National Importance. The institute started its first academic session in 2016-17, admitting the inaugural batch of students and commencing academic operations. Initially, the institute functioned from its transit campus located in the Government Engineering College (GEC) at Sejbahar, Raipur, wherein the first batch of students was inducted in 2016. This temporary arrangement provided the necessary infrastructure while the permanent campus was being developed. IIT Hyderabad was entrusted with the responsibility of mentoring the institute under the guidance of Prof. U.B. Desai, Director of IIT Hyderabad. This mentorship relationship proved crucial in establishing academic standards, curriculum frameworks, faculty recruitment, and institutional governance during IIT Bhilai's formative years.",
