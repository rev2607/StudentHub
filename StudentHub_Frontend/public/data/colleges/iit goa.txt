Ever since an IIT was allotted to Goa by the Central government in 2014, the new Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) at Goa started functioning from July 2016. IIT Goa was established by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, under The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, representing part of the government's ongoing commitment to expanding premier technical education infrastructure across India. Union Minister of Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar inaugurated Indian Institute of Technology, Goa on Saturday, July 30, 2016. He also laid the foundation stone for IIT Goa Students' Hostel. The newly set up IIT Goa shall function from temporary campus at Goa Engineering College, Farmagudi and will be mentored by IIT Bombay (also known as IIT Mumbai). The 300 acre new IIT Goa campus is expected to come up in a couple of years and is located about 88 km south of the capital city of Panaji. IIT Goa's history began with its establishment in 2016 as one of the new IITs, representing a significant milestone for Goa state in securing premier technical education infrastructure.",

In May 2020, four years after IIT Goa started running, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant handed over the documents of transfer of land (admeasuring 10 lakh square meters, approximately 247 acres) in Melauli, Sattari taluka, to the Director of IIT Goa, Prof. B.K. Mishra. This was far from the first site on which the government was trying to build the IIT Goa campus. Prior to this, sites at Canacona and Sanguem were identified, but plans to set up the campus in these places were scrapped after resistance and opposition from local residents in both these areas. The proposed Canacona site was initially envisioned as a 300-acre campus located 88 km south of capital city Panaji. In the engineering category of NIRF 2025, while NIT Goa retained its spot in the 101-150 rank band, IIT Goa also entered this same rank band, even though IIT Goa is operating from its temporary campus and awaiting land for its permanent campus from Goa govt to date since 2016. As of 2025, IIT Goa continues to operate from its temporary campus at GEC Farmagudi while the permanent campus development at Melauli, Sattari is awaited. The government remains committed to giving land for permanent IIT campus according to 2025 statements.",
