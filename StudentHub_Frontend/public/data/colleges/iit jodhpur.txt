        "content": "Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur (IIT Jodhpur or IITJ) stands as one of India's distinguished institutes of national importance, established in 2008 as part of the government's ambitious initiative to expand premier technical education infrastructure across the nation. The institute was originally named IIT Rajasthan and was established by an Act of Parliament in 2008 as one of eight new Indian Institutes of Technology founded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development under The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011. This legislative framework officially declared these new IITs as institutes of national importance, positioning them alongside India's most prestigious educational institutions with autonomy in governance, curriculum design, and degree-granting authority. IIT Rajasthan was inaugurated at its mentor campus IIT Kanpur by the then Minister of State for Higher Education Smt. D. Purandeswari. The mentorship relationship with IIT Kanpur during the formative years proved instrumental in establishing academic standards, administrative systems, and institutional culture. IIT Kanpur, one of India's premier technical institutions established in 1959, provided comprehensive guidance on curriculum development, faculty recruitment, research infrastructure setup, examination systems, and governance structures. The institute was formally renamed to Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur in November 2009, reflecting its permanent location and identity. As the metamorphosis of a butterfly undergoes a complete transformation, likewise IIT Jodhpur has undergone an intellectual evolution since 2008, developing from a fledgling institution into a mature technical university. The journey of this IIT began with the plan to move from IIT Kanpur to Jodhpur in the summer of 2010. With 2 batches of B.Tech students, around 10 faculty members and 10 staff members, the institute shifted to the Sun City, Jodhpur, establishing its transit campus operations.",
