The institute emerged as one of eight new Indian Institutes of Technology founded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, representing a strategic commitment to democratizing access to world-class technical education and fostering innovation ecosystems in underserved regions. The legislative framework that formalized IIT Gandhinagar's status came through The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011, which was passed by the Lok Sabha on 24th March 2011 and subsequently by the Rajya Sabha on 30th April 2012. This parliamentary approval officially declared these new IITs as institutes of national importance, positioning them alongside India's most prestigious educational institutions with autonomy in governance, curriculum design, and degree-granting authority. The institute commenced its inaugural academic session in 2008-09 from a temporary campus at Vishwakarma Government Engineering College in Chandkheda, Ahmedabad. The first batch of students was admitted to three undergraduate programs: Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, marking the beginning of what would become a transformative journey in technical education for western India. During its formative years, the institute operated under the mentorship of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, one of India's premier technical institutions. This mentorship arrangement proved crucial in establishing academic standards, curriculum frameworks, faculty recruitment protocols, research infrastructure, examination systems, and administrative processes aligned with IIT excellence. IIT Bombay's guidance ensured that IIT Gandhinagar inherited best practices while developing its unique institutional identity and innovative educational approaches. The founding faculty members often came from established IITs, premier international institutions, and research organizations, bringing academic excellence and diverse perspectives that accelerated the institute's development.",

        "content": "The permanent campus of IIT Gandhinagar occupies a spectacular location spread across approximately 400 acres (later expanded to 399 acres) on the western banks of the Sabarmati River in Palaj village, approximately 20 kilometers from Gandhinagar city, the capital of Gujarat. This riverside setting provides a serene and inspiring environment for academic pursuits, research activities, and holistic student development. The expansive campus provides ample space for academic buildings, research facilities, residential hostels, sports complexes, administrative offices, green spaces, and future expansion. The campus site carries unique historical significance, having served as a detention camp during World War II. This transformation from a place of confinement to a vibrant center of enlightenment, knowledge creation, and innovation symbolizes human progress and the transformative power of education to reshape landscapes, purposes, and destinies. The institute has consciously preserved this historical context while building modern infrastructure that reflects contemporary educational requirements and sustainability principles. In 2011, during his inaugural speech at the Amalthea technology summit, then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi announced that 'the state government has decided to give land on 99-year lease with a token amount of just one rupee for setting up a campus of IIT-Gandhinagar'. This extraordinarily generous gesture by the Gujarat government demonstrated strong state support for educational excellence and reflected the political leadership's vision of transforming Gujarat into an educational and innovation hub. The institute took possession of the 400+ acres of land in August 2012, and after intensive construction and infrastructure development, classes and other activities on the new permanent campus commenced in July 2015. This transition from the temporary campus to the award-winning permanent campus marked a significant milestone in the institute's journey, enabling it to realize its full potential with state-of-the-art facilities, expanded research infrastructure, and comprehensive residential amenities.",
