        "text": "Indian Institute of Technology Indore (IIT Indore or IITI) stands as one of India's distinguished institutes of national importance, established in 2009 as part of the government's ambitious initiative to expand premier technical education across the country. The institute emerged as one of eight new Indian Institutes of Technology founded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development under The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011, which was passed by the Lok Sabha on 24th March 2011 and by the Rajya Sabha on 30th April 2012. This legislative framework officially declared these new IITs as institutes of national importance, positioning them alongside India's most prestigious educational institutions. The foundation stone of IIT Indore was ceremonially laid by Shri Arjun Singh, the then Union HRD Minister, on 17th February 2009 at its permanent campus located in Simrol, approximately 25 kilometers from Indore city in Madhya Pradesh. The symbolic significance of this date marked the beginning of a transformational journey in technical education for central India, establishing an institution that would contribute significantly to the region's technological advancement and human capital development. The institute commenced its first academic session in 2009-10 with four undergraduate programs in Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Physics, accepting its inaugural batch of students with dreams of building a world-class institution. During its formative year, the institute operated from a temporary campus at the Institute of Engineering and Technology of Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (DAVV), functioning under the mentorship of IIT Bombay. This mentorship arrangement proved crucial in establishing academic standards, curriculum design, faculty recruitment, and administrative systems aligned with IIT excellence. Dr. Pradeep Mathur served as the founding director of IIT Indore, providing visionary leadership during the critical establishment phase. The institute celebrated a significant milestone on 8th June 2013 when it held its first Convocation Day, marking the graduation of its pioneering batch of students who had traversed the challenging journey of building traditions and academic culture in a nascent institution. Dr. Suhas Joshi, Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Dean of Alumni & Corporate Relations at IIT Bombay, subsequently assumed directorship, bringing extensive experience and academic leadership to guide the institute through its growth trajectory.",

Only students who qualify JEE Main and secure ranks within the prescribed cutoff (typically top 2.5 lakh ranks or top 20 percentile of appeared candidates) are eligible to appear for JEE Advanced. This two-stage screening process ensures that only the most academically talented students compete for seats at IITs, maintaining exceptionally high admission standards. The JEE Advanced examination consists of two papers (Paper 1 and Paper 2), each of three hours duration, testing candidates comprehensively on Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Both papers are compulsory, and performance in both is considered for rank calculation.

Candidates must register on the JoSAA portal after JEE Advanced results are declared, pay registration fees, fill their choice of institutes and branches in order of preference (up to several hundred options), lock their choices before the deadline for each round, and participate in the seat allocation process. The seat allocation algorithm considers the candidate's JEE Advanced rank, category, chosen preferences, and available seats to optimize allocations in each round. If allotted a seat at IIT Indore, candidates can either accept the seat and freeze their choice (no longer participating in subsequent rounds), accept the seat and participate in further rounds with the possibility of upgrading to a higher preference, or reject the seat.
