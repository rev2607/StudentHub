IIT Dharwad was established by the Ministry of Education (MoE), formerly known as Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, representing part of the government's ongoing commitment to expanding premier technical education infrastructure across India. The late Union Human Resources Development Minister S. R. Bommai had moved the proposal to the Centre seeking an IIT in Dharwad in the 1990s. In 1998, a committee headed by former ISRO chairman and space scientist Udupi Ramachandra Rao submitted its report recommending an IIT in Hubballi-Dharwad. The proposal gained momentum when Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the 2015-16 union budget sanctioned a budget for an IIT for Karnataka state. The state government suggested three locations - Dharwad, Mysuru, and Raichur - and ultimately Dharwad was selected. IIT Dharwad started functioning from July 2016 in a temporary campus, previously of the Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI) in Belur Industrial Area, on the outskirts of Dharwad city. The institute was formally inaugurated on 28 August 2016. IIT Dharwad began its academic journey in the Academic Year (AY) 2016-17 under the mentorship of IIT Bombay, one of India's premier IITs established in 1958. For the academic year 2016–2017, the institute offered B.Tech courses in three branches, initially admitting students to Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering.",

The campus is located at Chikkamalligawad village, Dharwad, Karnataka. The campus design is based on the theme of 'Sustainable Green Campus', inspired by historical origins of Hubballi-Dharwad. Phase 1A of the permanent campus was completed by the end of May 2023, and the institute started a few courses at permanent campus from December 2022. IIT Dharwad's permanent campus was inaugurated on 12 March 2023 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and dedicated to the nation. This marked a historic moment as it became the first green and smart IIT in India. The campus has been fully operational since March 2023. Originally, around 500 acres belonging to KIADB near Mummigatti on the Pune-Bangalore National Highway off Dharwad was identified for the IIT campus, but that deal was cancelled due to legal hurdles. Subsequently, the current site at Chikkamalligawad was finalized. The permanent campus features state-of-the-art infrastructure designed with sustainability principles, including green buildings, renewable energy systems, water conservation measures, and smart campus technologies. The campus represents a model for environmentally conscious educational infrastructure development.",

The site's journey from detention to education represents the broader narrative of India's evolution from colonialism to independence to becoming a global knowledge economy. IIT Dharwad has consciously embraced this historical context as part of its institutional identity, recognizing that the same land that once symbolized restriction now represents opportunity, freedom of thought, and intellectual liberation. This transformation underscores IIT Dharwad's role in fostering knowledge and innovation for future generations, turning a symbol of oppression into one of empowerment and progress for Karnataka and India.",
