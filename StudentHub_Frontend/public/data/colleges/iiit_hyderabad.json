  "About": {
    "Overview": "IIIT Hyderabad is a small, intense, and highly focused institute built almost entirely around computer science, electronics, and research. It suits students who genuinely enjoy coding, math, and problem-solving, and who are comfortable with a demanding pace rather than a laid-back college life. The campus is compact but dense with labs and academic spaces, which shapes a more 'workshop' feel than a sprawling traditional university. Student intake is relatively small, leading to a tight-knit community where peers, seniors, and faculty interact frequently, and students are pushed early into research groups and advanced courses.",
