        "content": "Indian Institute of Technology Mandi (IIT Mandi or IITM) stands as one of India's distinguished institutes of national importance, established in 2009 as part of the government's ambitious initiative to expand premier technical education infrastructure across the nation. The foundation stone was laid on 24th February 2009, marking the beginning of what would become a transformative journey in technical education for the Himalayan region. The institute emerged as one of eight new Indian Institutes of Technology founded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development under The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011, which was passed in the Lok Sabha on 24th March 2011 and by the Rajya Sabha on 30th April 2012. This legislative framework officially declared these new IITs as institutes of national importance, positioning them alongside India's most prestigious educational institutions with autonomy in governance, curriculum design, and degree-granting authority. The foundation stone laying ceremony was attended by then Minister of Human Resource Development, Shri Kapil Sibal, who inaugurated this ambitious project. The IIT Mandi Cell was set up at IIT Roorkee on 18th March 2009 to steer the activities of the nascent IIT Mandi. IIT Roorkee, one of India's oldest technical institutions established in 1847 (originally as Thomason College of Civil Engineering), served as the mentor institute for IIT Mandi, providing comprehensive guidance on curriculum development, faculty recruitment, research infrastructure setup, examination systems, and governance structures. The first batch of 97 students were admitted in July 2009, with classes starting at IIT Roorkee, the mentoring IIT, on 27th July 2009. This arrangement proved crucial in establishing academic standards and administrative processes aligned with IIT excellence.",

The campus location in Kamand Valley, approximately 14-15 kilometers from Mandi town, provides a spectacular setting with views of snow-capped Himalayan peaks and lush green surroundings. The campus is split into two halves: the North Campus and South Campus, with proper communication facilities established by the institute for students, staff, and faculty for movement between the two campuses. On 25th April 2015, IIT Mandi became the first of all the new IITs (established in 2008-2009) to completely shift B.Tech students to its permanent campus in Kamand, Mandi, marking a significant milestone in the institute's development. This achievement demonstrated IIT Mandi's rapid infrastructure development and commitment to providing students with state-of-the-art facilities. The ground-breaking ceremony marking the start of construction at the Kamand campus was held on 13th April 2012. The Preliminary Project Report (PPR) outlining a roadmap of 10 years for development of academic programs, campus development, and related issues was finalized on 25th April 2009, which included a scaled drawing of the 538 acres of land at Kamand and its land-use plan. The campus design reflects both modern architectural principles and sensitivity to the unique Himalayan environment, incorporating sustainable building practices, energy efficiency, and harmony with the natural surroundings.",
