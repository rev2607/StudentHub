The institute was proposed in the 2014 Union budget of India, the first budget of Narendra Modi led NDA government in July 2014, marking a significant milestone for Kerala. IIT Palakkad was established as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India through a Central Statute, the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961. Kerala, one of India's most educationally advanced states, had a long pending demand for an IIT. In 2012, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the Centre was seriously considering a proposal to set up an IIT in Kerala under the Twelfth Plan. This long-awaited aspiration came to fruition with the establishment of IIT Palakkad in 2015. On November 20, 2014, IIT Madras was designated as the mentor institute by the Ministry of Human Resources and Human Development, and the director of IIT Madras, Bhaskar Ramamurthi, assumed the role of Mentor Director. The institute's first academic session commenced on August 3, 2015, with a welcome program for the first batch of 120 B.Tech students – 30 each in Civil Engineering, Computer Science Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The academic activities at IIT Palakkad were formally launched at a temporary place in the premises of Ahalia integrated campus Kozhipara, Palakkad. IIT Palakkad was incorporated in the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961, through the Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2016, in September 2016, officially granting it the status of Institute of National Importance. In January 2017, P. B. Sunil Kumar, who was the Professor-in-charge, was appointed as the first Director of IIT Palakkad by then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, taking charge on January 18, 2017.",

The permanent campus, situated in Kanjikode, is divided into two sections—Nila (approximately 40 acres) and Sahyadri (about 500 acres) situated opposite each other. The Nila Campus was the first phase to become operational, with academic activities commencing in February 2019. Two batches of students were moved to the Nila Campus in the middle of February 2019, marking a significant transition from the temporary Ahalia campus. The Nila Campus features modern facilities like multimedia-enabled classrooms, student labs, a library, and Wi-Fi-enabled hostels, providing an excellent foundation for academic pursuits. The Sahyadri Campus houses a large academic complex named Saraswati, which contains a classroom complex for up to 2,000 students, demonstrating the institute's capacity for significant expansion. By August 2023, the institute had fully relocated its operations to the permanent campus, completing the transition from the temporary Ahalia campus. A vibrant campus with world-class sustainable green buildings has been planned, reflecting IIT Palakkad's commitment to environmental sustainability and modern infrastructure. The campus infrastructure includes six hostels: four in the tranquil Nila Campus and two in the serene Sahyadri Campus, providing comfortable accommodation for students.",

This transformation from a place of confinement during colonial times to a vibrant center of enlightenment, knowledge creation, and innovation symbolizes human progress and the transformative power of education to reshape landscapes, purposes, and destinies. The site's journey from detention to education represents the broader narrative of India's evolution from colonialism to independence to becoming a global knowledge economy. IIT Palakkad has consciously embraced this historical context as part of its institutional identity, recognizing that the same land that once symbolized restriction now represents opportunity, freedom of thought, and intellectual liberation. This transformation underscores IIT Palakkad's role in fostering knowledge and innovation for future generations, turning a symbol of oppression into one of empowerment and progress for Kerala and India.",

During the last round, IIT Palakkad BTech cutoff 2025 ranged between 6,454 and 16,753 for students in the General AI quota. As per the BTech final round closing ranks, CSE proved to be the most competitive for admission, with a lowest cutoff rank of 6,454. In the first round, this rank was even lower at 5,736. In 2024, the last round cutoff rank for CSE was 6,199. In 2023, the cutoff rank closed at 5,162 for students belonging to the General AI quota.
