The birth of IIT Bhubaneswar came on the 60th anniversary of India's Independence on 15th August 2007, when Manmohan Singh, then Prime Minister of India, made the historic announcement about the expansion of the IIT system in the country. Further, the National Development Council of the Planning Commission, in its 54th meeting held on 19th December 2007, approved the proposal as part of the 11th Five Year Plan (2007–12), marking a pivotal moment in India's higher education trajectory. The actual establishment of the institute was formally announced by the Minister of Human Resource Development Shri Arjun Singh in a press conference on 28th March 2008, setting the stage for what would become a transformative journey in technical education for eastern India. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of Higher Education, Government of India, vide its Order dated 9th May 2008, decided that IIT Kharagpur would mentor the setting up of this new IIT for 2–3 years. This mentorship relationship proved crucial in establishing academic standards, curriculum frameworks, faculty recruitment protocols, research infrastructure, examination systems, and administrative processes aligned with IIT excellence. IIT Bhubaneswar became the first amongst the eight new IITs to become operational with a sanctioned intake of 40 students each in the disciplines of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. Classes for the first batch of students started from the campus of IIT Kharagpur at Kharagpur, the mentor institute for IIT Bhubaneswar, on 23rd July 2008 with admission of 95 students. This distinguished beginning at the mentor campus demonstrated the deep commitment of IIT Kharagpur to nurture its newest sibling institution.",

The campus master plan was meticulously prepared by Vastunidhi Architects, Noida, envisioning a state-of-the-art educational infrastructure that would serve generations of students. The permanent campus at Kansapada, Khordha District, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 24th December 2018, marking a momentous occasion in the institute's evolution. This inauguration symbolized not just the physical completion of infrastructure but the maturation of an institution that had steadily built its reputation over a decade. The permanent campus is spreading over an expansive 936 acres of land, providing ample space for academic buildings, research facilities, residential hostels, sports complexes, administrative offices, green spaces, and future expansion. The campus is situated at the foot of Barunei Hill, which is famous for its rich history of sustained resistance during 1803–1804 against the British East India Company's forces. This historical significance adds a layer of cultural heritage to the modern educational mission, symbolizing the spirit of resistance, independence, and self-determination that the institute seeks to instill in its students. The location near Barunei Hill also provides a scenic and inspiring environment for academic pursuits, with natural beauty complementing modern infrastructure.",
