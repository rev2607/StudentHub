The institute emerged as one of eight new Indian Institutes of Technology founded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, under The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011. This legislative framework officially declared these new IITs as institutes of national importance, positioning them alongside India's most prestigious educational institutions with autonomy in governance, curriculum design, and degree-granting authority. The institute commenced its inaugural academic session in 2008-09, with classes initially held at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, operating under the mentorship of IIT Delhi. The first batch consisted of 40 students each in three disciplines: Computer Science Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, marking the beginning of what would become a transformative journey in technical education for northern India. IIT Delhi's mentorship proved crucial in establishing academic standards, curriculum frameworks, faculty recruitment protocols, research infrastructure, examination systems, and administrative processes aligned with IIT excellence. The Institute started functioning from its transit campus in Rupnagar from 1st August 2009, initially operating from the premises of Government Polytechnic College for Girls (Ropar), which was fully renovated and furnished to accommodate the growing needs of the institute. The foundation stone for the permanent campus was laid down on 24th February 2009 by the then Union HRD Minister Shri Arjun Singh, marking a significant milestone in the institute's journey. The permanent campus, spread over 525 acres along the banks of the Sutlej River, represents a massive investment in infrastructure and educational facilities. The institute has progressively shifted its operations to the permanent campus starting from June 2018, though some departments including Humanities, Mathematics, Physics, Chemical Engineering, and Civil Engineering, along with some hostels and labs, continued operations from both locations during the transition period.",

This riverside setting provides a serene and inspiring environment for academic pursuits, research activities, and holistic student development. The expansive campus provides ample space for academic buildings, research facilities, residential hostels, sports complexes, administrative offices, green spaces, and future expansion. The location in Punjab places the institute in India's agricultural heartland, providing unique opportunities for research in areas related to agriculture, water resources, environmental sustainability, and rural development. Rupnagar district, with its rich historical heritage dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization, provides a culturally vibrant backdrop for the institute. The campus site carries unique historical significance, having served as a detention camp during World War II, similar to some other IIT campuses. This transformation from a place of confinement to a vibrant center of enlightenment, knowledge creation, and innovation symbolizes human progress and the transformative power of education to reshape landscapes and destinies. The institute has consciously preserved this historical context while building modern infrastructure that reflects contemporary educational requirements and sustainability principles. The proximity to Chandigarh (approximately 50 km), a major planned city and union territory, provides access to urban amenities, cultural events, and connectivity to other major cities. The location also offers good rail and road connectivity to Delhi, making it accessible for students from across the country.",
