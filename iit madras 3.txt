        "establishment": "The genesis of IIT Madras traces back to 1956 when Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was on an official visit to West Germany. During this visit, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany offered technical assistance to establish a state-of-the-art higher technological institute in India. This generous offer materialized into the signing of the first Indo-German Agreement in Bonn, West Germany, in 1959, specifically for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras (now Chennai). This agreement represented the most significant international educational project sponsored by the Federal Republic of Germany at that time. The German government committed to providing comprehensive support including workshop and laboratory equipment worth approximately ₹1.8 crore (equivalent to ₹166 crores in 2024), services of twenty German professors for four to five years, four German foremen for workshops for two years, and training facilities for twenty Indian teachers in German institutions. The Institute was formally inaugurated in 1959 by Professor Humayun Kabir, Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs, marking the beginning of a new era in Indian technical education.",

These pioneering students came from across India, representing the diverse fabric of the nation. Dr. A. Lakshmanaswamy assumed office as the first Chairman of the Board of Governors, while Dr. B. Sengupto took charge as the first Director of the Institute, providing visionary leadership during the formative years. In 1961, a landmark decision was made when the Parliament of India declared IIT Madras as an 'Institute of National Importance' through the IIT Act, placing it among the premier institutions of the country. The first convocation ceremony was held on July 11, 1964, with Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, the then President of India, delivering the convocation address and awarding degrees to the inaugural batch of students. This historic moment marked the beginning of IIT Madras's tradition of academic excellence. A significant milestone in the institute's journey toward inclusivity came in 1966 when IIT Madras admitted its first women students in the BTech batch, breaking gender barriers in engineering education.",
