        "description": "The Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, established in 1961, stands as one of India's most prestigious institutions of higher technical education and the third-oldest IIT in the country. Located in Hauz Khas, South Delhi, the institute occupies a sprawling 320-acre campus that serves as a green oasis in the heart of India's capital city. IIT Delhi was founded through collaboration with the United Kingdom, marking a significant milestone in Indo-British educational cooperation during the post-independence era. Originally established as the College of Engineering and Technology with assistance from the British Government and the Federation of British Industries in London, the institution was later declared an Institution of National Importance under the Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 1963, and renamed the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. The institute has consistently maintained top rankings nationally and internationally, securing the 2nd position in NIRF Engineering category and 4th position in Overall category in 2024, and ranking 150th globally in QS World University Rankings 2025. With 13 academic departments, numerous research centers, and specialized schools, IIT Delhi serves approximately 10,000 students taught by over 550 distinguished faculty members. Since its inception, over 60,000 students have graduated from IIT Delhi across various disciplines including engineering, physical sciences, management, humanities, and social sciences, with nearly 5,070 receiving Ph.D. degrees and over 15,738 obtaining B.Tech. degrees.",

        "title": "Foundation and Historical Development",
        "establishment": "The genesis of IIT Delhi traces back to the broader vision for establishing Institutes of Technology across India, first introduced in 1945 by N.M. Sircar, then Member of Education on the Viceroy's Executive Council. Following the establishment of IIT Kharagpur in 1950 as the first IIT, the Government of India decided to establish more Institutes of Technology with assistance from friendly nations. The Government of India negotiated with the British Government for collaboration in setting up an Institute of Technology at Delhi. The British Government agreed in principle to such collaboration, initially preferring to start modestly by establishing a College of Engineering and Technology at Delhi. A trust called the Delhi Engineering College Trust was established with help from the UK Government and the Federation of British Industries in London. During his visit to India, H.R.H. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, laid the foundation stone of the college at Hauz Khas on January 28, 1959, symbolizing the commitment to building world-class technical education infrastructure. The College of Engineering and Technology was registered as a society on June 14, 1960, under the Societies Registration Act No. XXI of 1860 (Registration No. S1663 of 1960-61). The first admissions were made in 1961, with students asked to report to the college on August 16, 1961. The college was formally inaugurated on August 17, 1961, by Prof. Humayun Kabir, Minister of Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs, marking the beginning of IIT Delhi's distinguished journey in technical education.",

        "initial_operations": "Initially, the college operated from the Kashmiri Gate campus of Delhi College of Engineering (now known as Delhi Technological University) before shifting to its permanent campus in Hauz Khas. The Department of Textile Technology from Delhi College of Engineering was relocated en bloc to mark the beginning of IIT Delhi at its new Hauz Khas campus. The college was initially affiliated to the University of Delhi. According to Section 4 of the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961, each IIT is constituted as a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal. The college was later accorded the status of a Deemed University with powers to decide its own academic policy, conduct its own examinations, and award its own degrees. This autonomy enabled IIT Delhi to design innovative curricula, maintain high academic standards, and respond dynamically to emerging technological trends. IIT Delhi celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2011, commemorating 50 years of academic excellence and contribution to nation-building. The Diamond Jubilee was celebrated in 2021, marking 60 years of sustained excellence in technical education, research, and innovation. Over the decades, IIT Delhi has evolved from a modest beginning with 100 students to a comprehensive technological university serving thousands of students annually.",
