        "description": "The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, established in 1951, stands as India's first IIT and one of the nation's most prestigious institutions of higher technical education. Founded in the historic Hijli Detention Camp in Kharagpur, West Bengal, approximately 120 km west of Kolkata, IIT Kharagpur symbolizes India's transformation from colonial legacy to technological excellence. The institute occupies a magnificent 2,100-acre campus, making it one of the largest and most expansive educational campuses in Asia - larger than IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, and IIT Kanpur combined. With its sprawling green landscape spanning 55 kilometres of roadways, IIT Kharagpur houses a self-contained township of over 15,000-16,000 inhabitants including approximately 10,000-14,500 students, 700+ faculty members, and 1,000+ staff members. The institute has consistently maintained top rankings nationally, securing 5th position in NIRF Engineering category and 6th position in Overall category in 2024, and ranking 271st globally in QS World University Rankings 2024. Operating with the Sanskrit motto 'Yogah Karmashu Koushalam' (Excellence in action is Yoga) from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, IIT Kharagpur was declared an Institution of National Importance by the Parliament of India on September 15, 1956, and granted autonomous university status.",

        "establishment": "The genesis of IIT Kharagpur holds profound historical and symbolic significance in India's journey from colonial rule to independent nation-building. The institution was established on the blessed land of Hijli in the district of Medinipur (now Paschim Medinipur), West Bengal, where many freedom fighters had sacrificed their lives for India's independence. The infamous Hijli Detention Camp, which once imprisoned freedom fighters struggling against British rule, was transformed into a temple of technical education - a powerful symbol of India's transformation. This transformation was so significant that in the first convocation address on March 2, 1956, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, remarked: 'Here in the place of that Hijli detention camp stands this fine monument of India today representing India's urges, India's future in the making. This picture seems to me symbolical of the changes that are coming to India.' The institute was born out of the desire 'to build up a prosperous, democratic and progressive nation' and took responsibility for educating young generations with 'the dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.'",

Ghosh (also known as Sir Gnan Chandra Ghosh), an eminent scientist. The classrooms, laboratories, and administrative offices were initially housed in the historic building of the Hijli Detention Camp itself. The Institute started its academic programme with only ten departments, establishing the foundation for what would become one of Asia's premier technological universities. On March 1952, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of the New Building, marking the beginning of the permanent campus development. The first Board of Governors was constituted with Dr. B.C. Roy as Chairman and distinguished members including Mr. N.R. Sarkar, Sir Jehangir J. Gandhi, Dr. Tarachand, Mr. K.R.K. Menon, Mr. T. Sivasankar, Dr. S.S. Bhatnagar, Mr. H. Kabir, and Dr. J.C. Ghosh. Some eminent scholars from Europe joined the Institute in its formative years, with the first two being Prof. R.A. Kraus and Prof. H. Tischner, who was incidentally the first Head of Electronics and ECE Department, bringing international expertise to the nascent institution.",

Moser, whose vision shaped the campus into a harmonious blend of functionality and aesthetic beauty. A large amount of financial help was available from the Ministry of Industry and Supply for procuring a number of machine tools and equipment. The Institute Workshop was established as one of the best in the country, providing hands-on training facilities for students in manufacturing and production technologies. The campus development followed a systematic plan creating distinct zones for academic activities, residential facilities, recreational amenities, and administrative functions. From the modest start in 1950-51, IIT Kharagpur engaged in a steady process of development, transforming the vast tree-laden campus spreading over 2,100 acres into a self-contained township. The campus features brick-constructed buildings creating warm aesthetics while being environmentally sustainable, interspersed with lush green spaces, water bodies, and landscaped gardens that provide a serene environment conducive to academic pursuits and research activities.",
