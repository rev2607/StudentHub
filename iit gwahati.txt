        "description": "The Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, established in 1994, stands as the sixth member of the prestigious IIT fraternity and the youngest among the first-generation IITs. Located on a sprawling 285-hectare (704-acre) campus on the north bank of the majestic river Brahmaputra in Amingaon, North Guwahati, Assam, approximately 20 km from the heart of Guwahati city, IIT Guwahati represents India's commitment to expanding access to premier technical education in the North-Eastern region. The institute's establishment was rooted in the historic 1985 Assam Accord signed between the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the Government of India, which specifically mentioned setting up an IIT to improve educational facilities in Assam. The academic programme commenced in 1995 with the first batch of students admitted into the Bachelor of Technology programme. Within a remarkably short span of three decades, IIT Guwahati has built world-class infrastructure for advanced research and education, equipped with state-of-the-art scientific and engineering instruments. The institute has consistently maintained top rankings nationally and internationally, securing 7th position in NIRF Engineering category (maintained for past 4 years), 9th position in NIRF Overall category 2023, and achieving a remarkable 344th position globally in QS World University Rankings 2025 (advancing 20 spots from previous year). Currently serving over 10,000 students with approximately 400+ faculty members, IIT Guwahati operates 11 academic departments, 7 inter-disciplinary academic centres, and 5 schools covering all major engineering, science, healthcare, management, and humanities disciplines.",

This accord ended the six-year-long Assam Agitation that had demanded identification and deportation of illegal immigrants, protection of Assamese language and culture, and economic development of the state. Clause 7 of the Assam Accord specifically mentioned the general improvement in educational facilities in Assam and the setting up of an Indian Institute of Technology, recognizing education as crucial for the region's development. IIT Guwahati was established in 1994 by an Act of Parliament, becoming the sixth IIT and the first major technical institution of national importance in Northeast India. This establishment fulfilled a long-standing aspiration of the people of the North-Eastern region for access to premier technical education close to home, reducing the need for talented students from the region to migrate to other parts of India for quality engineering education. The institute was officially recognized as an Institution of National Importance by the Government of India, placing it among the nation's premier institutions with special status and autonomy.",

The selection process followed the same rigorous standards as other IITs through the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), ensuring that IIT Guwahati attracted top talent from across India from its very inception. In 1998, a significant milestone was achieved when the first batch of students was accepted into the Master of Technology (M.Tech) program through the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) examination, marking the institute's expansion into postgraduate education and research. The institute started with founding departments covering core engineering disciplines and gradually expanded its academic offerings. Despite being one of the youngest IITs, IIT Guwahati demonstrated remarkable growth trajectory, rapidly building infrastructure, recruiting distinguished faculty from leading institutions worldwide, establishing research laboratories, and creating an academic ecosystem comparable to older IITs. The founding faculty and early batches faced challenges including developing infrastructure from scratch, establishing academic traditions, and building the institute's reputation, but their dedication laid strong foundations for the institution's future success.",
