IIIT Manipur (Indian Institute of Information Technology Manipur) is a PPP‑mode Institute of National Importance located at Mantripukhri, Imphal, with a tech‑focused B.Tech portfolio (CSE and ECE), growing placements, and a mix of temporary and city campus facilities.  It is a good fit for students who want a small, coding‑oriented government institute in the North‑East, and are comfortable with a still‑evolving campus environment.[1][2][3][4][5]

***

## Overview

- IIIT Manipur was established in 2015 under the IIIT (PPP) scheme, with support from the Government of India, Government of Manipur and industry partners, and is recognised as an Institute of National Importance.[2][4][6]
- The institute currently operates from its city campus at Mantripukhri, Imphal, with a transit setup while work towards more permanent infrastructure continues.[7][3][1]

Key academic identity:

- Core focus areas are Computer Science & Engineering and Electronics & Communication Engineering at the B.Tech level, with some higher degree and research programmes mentioned in recent profiles.[8][2]
- As a relatively small institute, IIIT Manipur offers close‑knit batches and more faculty interaction, which many students use for project work and coding practice.[5][1][2]

***

## Courses and Fee

IIIT Manipur offers a compact program portfolio, centred on IT and electronics.[2][8]

### Programmes offered

| Level | Programme | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| UG    | B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) | Flagship, highest demand and highest placements. [1][2] |
| UG    | B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) | Second core branch. [2][8] |
| PG/PhD | Limited PG/PhD programmes in related disciplines | Listed in some institute/guide descriptions; intakes are smaller and may vary by year. [2][3][6] |

### Fee structure (B.Tech – indicative)

Recent fee information shows the B.Tech programme has medium tuition but significant hostel cost over four years.[9][10][1]

| Fee head                                | Approx. amount | Remarks |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|---------|
| B.Tech tuition (total 4 years)          | About ₹8.8 lakh | Official figure quoted via sanctioned data. [1][9] |
| One‑time fee (admission + caution etc.) | About ₹15,000  | Payable at admission; caution refundable. [1][9] |
| Hostel fee (total B.Tech duration)      | About ₹3.0–3.1 lakh | Approx. ₹3.02 lakh mentioned for entire course. [1] |
| Additional hostel deposits              | Around ₹4,000 (hall + mess refundable deposits) | E.g., hall ₹1,000 + mess ₹3,000 as per hostel fee table. [9] |

- A broader fee range of about ₹50,000 to ₹8.8 lakh is cited for various programmes, depending on duration and level.[9]
- Students generally find overall “value for money” around mid‑range (around 3.3/5 in reviews), mainly because placements and exposure are improving but campus is still developing.[9][2]

## Admissions

B.Tech admissions to IIIT Manipur are through JEE Main followed by JoSAA/CSAB counselling.[11][8][2]

### Mode and eligibility

- Entrance exam: JEE Main (current session).[8][11]
- Counselling: Centralised JoSAA, with further spot and special rounds via CSAB as applicable; candidates must explicitly choose “Indian Institute of Information Technology Manipur” and their preferred branch.[12][2][8]
- Eligibility: 10+2 with Physics, Mathematics and another required subject, with minimum marks and category relaxations as per JEE Main rules.[12][8]

### Admission flow (B.Tech)

1. Appear for JEE Main.  
2. Register and participate in JoSAA counselling, listing IIIT Manipur CSE/ECE among choices.[2][8]
3. If allotted, report online/onsite, complete document verification and pay the initial admission fee.[11][2]

- CSE cut‑offs are generally more competitive than ECE, reflecting the stronger demand and placement prospects.[6][1][2]
- There is no separate institute‑level entrance exam for B.Tech; all seats are filled via JEE Main rank.[8][2]

## Placements

With its first few batches now graduated, IIIT Manipur is showing visible improvement in placement statistics, especially for CSE.[13][14][1][2]

### Placement snapshot (recent trend)

| Metric / aspect             | Details (indicative) |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Overall placement rate      | Around 70–75% in recent batches (B.Tech), as mentioned in fee/review notes and placement summaries. [9][13][14] |
| Highest package             | Up to about ₹40–45 LPA reported in recent years. [9][14] |
| Average package             | Moderate single‑ to low double‑digit LPA, varying by branch and batch (CSE higher than ECE). [13][14] |

- Some reviews mention that only students with higher CGPA are allowed to sit in certain campus drives, which pushes others towards off‑campus opportunities.[5][9]
- Recruiters are mainly IT services companies, smaller product‑based firms and start‑ups, with roles in software development, support and analytics; top elite product companies are still fewer compared to older IIITs/NITs.[14][13][2]

***

## Rankings

As a young and relatively small IIIT, IIIT Manipur’s presence in national ranking tables is limited, but its legal status and growing reputation among aspirants are notable.[6][2][8]

- Under the IIIT Act, it enjoys Institute of National Importance status, which is highly relevant for credibility and government recognition even if it does not appear high in commercial ranking lists.[4][6]
- In independent “IIIT comparison” articles and coaching guides, IIIT Manipur is usually placed in the lower‑middle cluster of IIITs, often preferred by students from the North‑East or those seeking a government CSE seat at moderate JEE Main ranks.[6][5][2]

***

## Facilities

IIIT Manipur currently runs from a transit/city campus at Mantripukhri with hostels located inside and outside the core campus depending on gender and batch.[3][1][9]

### Campus and academic infrastructure

- The campus provides essential academic facilities such as classrooms, labs, Wi‑Fi, and basic computing resources; some descriptions explicitly note that the college is still operating on a “temporary campus”.[5][9][2]
- A library, computer labs and common study areas are available for coursework and project work; however, students sometimes mention constraints typical of a developing campus (space, equipment, etc.).[9][2]

### Hostel and living facilities

Student reviews give a detailed, humanised picture of the hostel setup.[7][9]

| Feature              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Boys’ hostel         | At one point hosted outside the main campus, with facilities like Wi‑Fi, geysers, chargeable washing machines, tables, chairs, almirahs and beds. [9] |
| Girls’ hostel        | Reported as being inside the campus, which some students feel is more convenient and secure. [9] |
| Hostel fee           | Around ₹50,000–53,000 per year in hostel fee tables, plus refundable hall/mess deposits; cumulative hostel outlay is about ₹3.02 lakh across the degree. [1][9] |
| Mess & amenities     | Mess is basic but functional; reviews mention adequate facilities but not luxury, with typical government‑college pros and cons. [9][5] |

- Students often point out that all “needed facilities” are present but the ambience still feels like a new, minimal campus rather than a polished, established one.[2][5][9]

***

## Faculty

IIIT Manipur has a compact faculty body aligned to CSE and ECE, complemented by visiting/contract faculty as the institute scales.[3][8][2]

- Faculty expertise covers core Computer Science, Electronics and allied fields, with research interests in areas such as networks, AI, communications and embedded systems.[6][2]
- The small batch size allows students to interact regularly with teachers for doubt clearing, mini‑projects and guidance on competitive programming and higher studies.[1][5][2]

Typical academic structure:

- CSE: courses in programming, data structures, algorithms, DBMS, OS, networks, AI/ML and software engineering.[8][2]
- ECE: courses in analog/digital electronics, signals and systems, communication engineering, microcontrollers and VLSI basics.[2][8]

## Reviews (Student Perspective)

Student reviews on major portals and videos provide a grounded view that is helpful for counselling‑style content.[1][5][9][2]

- Positives mentioned:  
  - Faculty are generally described as helpful and supportive.[1][2]
  - Good peer group and coding‑focused environment for a government college of this size.[5][9]
  - Hostel rooms have most basic amenities (Wi‑Fi, geyser, storage, study furniture), and mess charges are seen as manageable.[9]

- Concerns highlighted:  
  - Campus and hostels are still partly temporary or separated (boys outside, girls inside), which some students find inconvenient.[5][9]
  - Placement opportunities are improving but not yet at the level of top‑tier IIITs/NITs, so students rely on both campus and off‑campus efforts.[13][14][9]
  - Limited city life and developing infrastructure around the campus.[2][5]
