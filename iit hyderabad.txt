        "description": "The Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, established in 2008, stands as one of India's youngest yet fastest-growing premier institutions of higher technical education. Founded through the Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act 2011 by the Ministry of Education, Government of India, IIT Hyderabad represents a new generation of IITs established to expand access to quality technical education across India. Located in Kandi village near Sangareddy district in Telangana, approximately 30 km from Hyderabad city on National Highway 65, the institute occupies a sprawling 576-600 acre campus that was once a detention camp during World War II. IIT Hyderabad began functioning on August 18, 2008, from a temporary campus at the Ordnance Factory Medak (OFMK) in Yeddumailaram under the founding directorship of Prof. U.B. Desai, before moving to its permanent eco-friendly campus in July 2015. The institute has achieved remarkable progress in a short span, consistently ranking among India's top 10 engineering institutions, securing 7th position in NIRF Engineering category and 12th in Overall category in 2025, and ranking 681-690 globally in QS World University Rankings 2025. Currently led by Prof. B.S. Murty as Director, IIT Hyderabad has been designated as an Institute of National Importance and Institute of Eminence, serving approximately 3,000-4,000 students taught by over 250+ distinguished faculty members across 12 academic departments, 14 research centers, and numerous specialized facilities.",
