        "description": "The Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University) Varanasi, commonly known as IIT (BHU) Varanasi, stands as one of India's oldest and most prestigious technical institutions with a glorious history spanning over a century. Located in the magnificent 1,300-acre campus of Banaras Hindu University on the banks of the holy river Ganga in the ancient spiritual city of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, IIT (BHU) uniquely combines traditional Indian values with modern technological education. Established in 1919 as the Banaras Engineering College (BENCO), the institution pioneered engineering education in India by being the first in the country to start degree courses in Mining, Metallurgy, Ceramic Engineering, and Pharmaceutics. After operating as the Institute of Technology, BHU (IT-BHU) from 1968, it was officially designated as an Indian Institute of Technology in 2012 by the Government of India, becoming IIT (BHU) Varanasi and joining the prestigious IIT system. Currently ranked 10th in NIRF Engineering category and 30th in Overall category in 2024, IIT (BHU) serves over 10,000 students with approximately 400+ faculty members across 18 academic departments, 3 interdisciplinary schools, and numerous research centers. The institute has been declared an Institution of National Importance under the Institutes of Technology Act.",

BENCO was created with just 75 students, 2 departments, and 2 hostels, marking the beginning of systematic engineering education in India. BHU has the credit of being the first in the country to start degree classes in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, Mining Engineering, and Pharmaceutics, demonstrating the foresight of its founder in recognizing the need for technical education for nation-building in colonial India. The first convocation ceremony at BHU was held on December 2, 1920, marking a milestone in India's educational history. The Department of Geology was started under BENCO in 1920, introducing courses in Mining and Metallurgy. The Department of Industrial Chemistry was started in July 1921, expanding the scope of technical education beyond traditional engineering disciplines.",

In 1944, these departments were raised to the status of a college, forming the College of Mining and Metallurgy (MINMET), creating specialized focus on mineral resources and metallurgical processes critical for industrial growth. In 1932, the College of Technology (TECHNO) was established, further expanding technical education offerings. The founder, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, started courses in Glass and Ceramic Technology as early as 1924 with the noble objective of advancing these technologies in India. The Department of Ceramic Engineering became the first-ever department established in pre-independent India and Asia to develop skilled human resources for ceramic industries country-wide, and it remains the only such department in the Indian IIT system even today. The Ceramic Engineering department holds an unparalleled and significant contribution to building the nation throughout the past 100 years with vast contributions towards academic, industrial, and R&D areas.",

A Department of Electronics Engineering was also established during this integration. This consolidation created a comprehensive technical institution under the BHU umbrella. In 1969, these three colleges were integrated together to form a stand-alone Institute of Technology, BHU, operating with greater autonomy while remaining part of the larger Banaras Hindu University structure. The departments of Applied Physics, Applied Mathematics, and Applied Chemistry were established in 1985, strengthening the scientific foundation underpinning engineering education and expanding research capabilities in fundamental sciences.",
